## keywords_joiner ##

The keywords joiner can combine up to 3 lists of keywords to generate a single list that contains the keywords from all 3 lists in every possible sequence.

It works only with OS X or Unix-like systems like Linux.

Example:
========

List A:
apple
orange

List B:
big
juicy

Output:
apple big
apple juicy
orange big
orange juicy
big apple
big orange
juicy apple
juicy orange



Usage Instructions
==================

In the same folder as "keywords_joiner.rb", put at least 2 lists. Each keyword should be on a new line. Put your first list and name it A.txt, and your second list and name it B.txt. If you have a third list, you can also put your list C.txt in this folder.

Now open up a terminal window, go to the folder containing "keywords_joiner.rb", and type "ruby keywords_joiner.rb".

There should now be a file called "output.txt" in the same folder as keywords_joiner.

Enjoy!
